This is a program that querys the Internet for lyrics to a specific
song and then searches these lyrics for matches to a list of regular
expression.

Example use is to search a database of songs for those that
contain explicit lyrics and then flag these songs. An SQL frontend
compatible with the Rivendell Radio Automation software is also
being developed as part of this project. For more information on
Rivendell, see http://www.rivendellaudio.org/.

This project makes use of the LyricFly lookup API. A production key
is necessary to make full use of the program. For more info, see
the website: http://lyricsfly.com/api/. Temporary weekly keys
are also available from the previous link. To request a full key,
visit http://lyricsfly.com/.
