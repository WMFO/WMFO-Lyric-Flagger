This is a program that query the Internet for lyrics to a specific
song and then searches these lyrics for matches to a list of regular
expression. Example use is to search a database of songs for those that
contain explicit lyrics and then flag these songs.

This project makes use of the LyricFly lookup API. A production key
is necessary to make full use of the program. For more info, see
the website: http://lyricsfly.com/api/. Temporary weekly keys
are also available form the previous link. Please visit
